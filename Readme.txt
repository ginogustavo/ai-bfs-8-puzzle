1. In order to run the code, you need installed Java 8

2. If an IDE is available you can load the classes in any folder (classes are not located in any specific package)

Files
--------
Action.java
Node.java
PuzzleApp.java
TreeSearch.java

3. You can also run the compiled files: Just need to run in a the command line: java PuzzleApp

Running: The program is expecting an intro (the configuration of states), if just pressed entered it will use the default.
